# ‚úÖ JARVIS Address Update - Now Calls You "Boss"

## What Changed

JARVIS now addresses you as **"Boss"** instead of "Sir" or "Ma'am" in all conversations.

```
ü§ñ JARVIS: "Good day, Sir. How may I be of assistance?"
ü§ñ JARVIS: "You're welcome, Ma'am. Anything else?"
```

### After:

```
ü§ñ JARVIS: "Good day, Boss. How may I be of assistance?"
ü§ñ JARVIS: "You're welcome, Boss. Anything else?"
```
