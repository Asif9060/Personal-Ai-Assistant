# Jarvis AI Assistant Development Prompt

## Overview
Create a voice-activated AI assistant (like Jarvis from Iron Man) that can control and automate my PC. Let's approach this systematically, starting with basic functionality and expanding capabilities gradually.

## Phase 1: Basic Voice Interaction
Develop a voice recognition system that can:
- Listen to my voice commands continuously
- Process natural language to understand basic queries
- Respond verbally with appropriate information for queries like:
  - "What time is it?"
  - "What's the weather today?"
  - "Hello Jarvis"
  - "Tell me a joke"

## Technical Requirements
- Use a speech recognition library (like SpeechRecognition for Python)
- Implement text-to-speech for responses
- Create a wake word system (e.g., "Hey Jarvis")
- Design a simple conversation flow with appropriate responses

## Future Expansion
After basic functionality is working, we'll expand to:
- System control (opening applications, managing files)
- Web searches and information retrieval
- Calendar and reminder functionality
- Smart home integration

Do not implement the Future Expansion features yet.

Please provide a step-by-step implementation plan with code examples for the initial voice interaction system.
