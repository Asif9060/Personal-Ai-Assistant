# ‚úÖ JARVIS Startup Task Announcement - COMPLETED

## What Changed

JARVIS now **reads out your actual pending tasks** when starting up, instead of just telling you "how many" tasks you have.

### Before (Old Behavior):

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. How can I help you?"
JARVIS: "üìù You have 3 pending tasks"
```

### After (New Behavior):

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. Let me update you on your tasks."
JARVIS: "You have 3 pending tasks: Call mom, Finish the presentation, and Buy groceries due September 20th"
```

## How It Works Now

### üîπ **With Tasks:**

-  **Greeting:** "Let me update you on your tasks"
-  **Announcement:** Reads out each specific task by name
-  **Due Dates:** Mentions due dates when available
-  **Priority:** Mentions high priority tasks
-  **Limit:** Reads up to 3 tasks (to avoid long speech), mentions count if more

### üîπ **No Tasks:**

-  **Greeting:** "How can I help you today?"
-  **Announcement:** "You have no pending tasks. How can I help you today?"

### üîπ **Smart Features:**

-  **Urgent Tasks First:** Due tasks are announced before regular tasks
-  **Natural Speech:** Tasks are spoken in natural language flow
-  **Prioritization:** High priority tasks are mentioned specifically
-  **Count Handling:** "one pending task" vs "3 pending tasks"

## Examples

### Single Task:

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. Let me update you on your tasks."
JARVIS: "You have one pending task: Call the bank due September 20th"
```

### Multiple Tasks:

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. Let me update you on your tasks."
JARVIS: "You have 3 pending tasks: Call mom, Finish the presentation, and Buy groceries due September 20th"
```

### No Tasks:

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. How can I help you today?"
JARVIS: "You have no pending tasks. How can I help you today?"
```

### Many Tasks (6+):

```
JARVIS: "JARVIS AI assistant online. Let me update you on your tasks."
JARVIS: "You have 6 pending tasks: Call mom, Finish presentation, Buy groceries, plus 3 more tasks"
```
